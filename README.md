# Red-wine-quality-analysis-
Wine classification is a difficult task since taste is the least understood of the human senses. A good wine quality prediction can be very useful in the certification phase, since currently the sensory analysis is performed by human tasters, being clearly a subjective approach. An automatic predictive system can be integrated into a decision support system, helping the speed and quality of the performance. Furthermore, a feature selection process can help to analyse the impact of the analytical tests. If it is concluded that several input variables are highly relevant to predict the wine quality, since in the production process some variables can be controlled, this information can be used to improve the wine quality. 
Classification models used here are: -


	Logistic Regression. 

	K Nearest Neighbour.

	Support Vector Machine (linear classifier).

	Gaussian Naïve Bayes.

	Decision Tree Classifier.

	Random Forest Classifier.
